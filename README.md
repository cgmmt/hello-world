This is a refresher on how to use Git after many years away.

Cody here, and I like to learn new things and make them available for the widest audiences possible.  Git will help me accomplish this through their awesome platform.  Sadly I had to start a new Git account since they lost my old account and all my past projects.  Tear.  Many tears infact!
